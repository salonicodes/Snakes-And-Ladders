<h2>Game's Object Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>The board will have 100 cells numbered from 1 to 100.</li>
<li>The game will have a six sided dice numbered from 1 to 6 and will always give a random number on rolling it.</li>
<li>Each player has a piece which is initially kept outside the board (i.e., at position 0).</li>
<li>Each player rolls the dice when their turn comes.</li>
<li>Based on the dice value, the player moves their piece forward that number of cells. Ex: If the dice value is 5 and the piece is at position 21, the player will put their piece at position 26 now (21+5).</li>
<li>A player wins if it exactly reaches the position 100 and the game ends there.</li>
<li>After the dice roll, if a piece is supposed to move outside position 100, it does not move.</li>
<li>The board also contains some snakes and ladders.</li>
<li>Each snake will have its head at some number and its tail at a smaller number.</li>
<li>Whenever a piece ends up at a position with the head of the snake, the piece should go down to the position of the tail of that snake.</li>
<li>Each ladder will have its start position at some number and end position at a larger number.</li>
<li>Whenever a piece ends up at a position with the start of the ladder, the piece should go up to the position of the end of that ladder.</li>
<li>There could be another snake/ladder at the tail of the snake or the end position of the ladder and the piece should go up/down accordingly.</li>
<li>There won’t be a snake at 100.</li>
<li>There won’t be multiple snakes/ladders at the same start/head point.</li>
<li>It is possible to reach 100, i.e., it is possible to win the game.</li>
<li>Snakes and Ladders do not form an infinite loop.</li>
</ul>
