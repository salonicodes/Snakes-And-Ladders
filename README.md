# Snakes-And-Ladders
Solving the Design Problem- Snakes and Ladders

## Problem Statement
Create a snake and ladder application. The application should take as input (from the command line or a file):
<ul>
<li>Number of snakes (s) followed by s lines each containing 2 space-separated numbers denoting the head and tail positions of the snake.</li>
<li>Number of ladders (l) followed by l lines each containing 2 space-separated numbers denoting the start and end positions of the ladder.</li>
<li>Number of players (p) followed by p lines each containing a name.</li>
</ul>

<p>After taking these inputs, you should print all the moves in the form of the current player name followed by a random number between 1 to 6 denoting the die roll and the initial and final position based on the move.</p>

<p>Format: <b> &lt;player_name&gt; rolled a &lt;dice_value&gt; and moved from &lt;initial_position&gt; to &lt;final_position&gt; </b> </p>

<p>When someone wins the game, print that the player won the game.</p>
<p>Format: <b>&lt;player_name&gt; wins the game.</b></p>
